Implement Scheduler Assignment
</p></h2>

### Design:
To properly measure the effectiveness of my design against others, simple metrics need to be defined. The first of these metrics is turnaround time, which is a measure of performance and is the average time it takes each thread to complete. Thus, the longer threads have to wait in the queue, the worse the turnaround time will be. The second metric is response time, which measures reactivity and is the time before initial scheduling (executing) of each thread. Thus, the longer the time between thread scheduling, the worse the response time. Now that there are defined metrics, I can compare my design to others.

I decided to implement a FIFO (First In First Out) or FCFS (First Come First Serve) scheduler that works by running each process in the order they arrive.

FIFO is the simplest scheduler implementation, as it's just a simple queue. Thus it has sub-optimal turnaround times, in general, compared to others such as SJF (Shortest Job First) or STCF (Shortest Time to Completion First). Both of these scheduler implementations attempt to run the shortest of all the threads in the run queue first, resulting in equal or quicker turn around times than FIFO (see diagrams below).

While turnaround time is important in performance, reactivity is important; after all, you don't want to leave a user waiting.
Once again, my FIFO implementation is outdone by another scheduler implementation, RR (Round Robin) scheduling. This implementation focuses response time by rapidly switching between threads in the queue until each is complete.

Allowing for much quicker response times and even exponentially better turnaround times when working on a multi-core system, as threads can be spread between cores. However, in the OS161 implementation, there is only a single core, and thus the turn around time ends up being worse due to the cost of switching between threads. So much worse, FIFO ends up with better turnaround times, which is reflected in the benchmarks' results.
